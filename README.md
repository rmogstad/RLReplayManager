# RLReplayManager

This will display information about your Rocket League replays, and allow you to upload them to www.rocketleaguereplays.com.  It will also (optionally) auto-upload any time a new replay is created, as long as the program is running.

## How to use:

1. Download the app: https://github.com/rmogstad/RLReplayManager/releases
2. Get your API key.
  - Visit https://www.rocketleaguereplays.com/replays/upload/
  - Click the "click here" link, and copy your API key
3. Enter your API key in the app (under "File>Update API Key")
4. Select replays (one or more) to upload, and click the Upload button
5. (optional) Select "File->Auto Upload New Replays" if you want replays to upload as soon as they are created.

## Bugs
If I knew, I would fix them.  Feel free to create an issue (https://github.com/rmogstad/RLReplayManager/issues)
